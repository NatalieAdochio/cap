My capstone is a simple adaption of the dancing tree. So instead of moving to  
music my Fractal tree is expanded on by using it in tandem with Gridworld (from the cityscape lab)
The way it connects with the past labs and concepts we did in class was that it did loops, Gridworld, 
and the fractal tree. The program actually doesn't work the way I intended but after a lot of research 
into the problem, the repaint method has its own thread-causing a data race, I still couldn't solve the
problem.
